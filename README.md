# Country-flag-picker
This document will serve to guide you through my thought process as I was building the app. 
 
From a developers perspective: I had an easy time importing the JSON file and used for loops to access the JSON objects. The biggest difficulty I had was trying to convert the Unicode to emoji and building a fully functional multi-selector dropdown menu for the countries. My program does display the flag code which can be turned in an emoji.  
 
From a designers perspective: My design process:  1) What is the purpose of the app?  2) Who are my users?  3) Wireframing with sketch and creating a functional UI with Invision.  4) Development  5) Testing 
 
From a Users perspective:  There are few UI components that I need to make cleaner. 
 
Bugs I need to fix: Resetting country dropdown menu when re-selecting continent. Search bar is not smart functioning with auto detection.
